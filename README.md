# bootstrap-timetable
It's a class schedule that was created by bootstrap rows and columns. There are three times, when there are two another columns in a bigger one. I give some rows, and columns unique background and border. The background of the webpage is in the body tag. It has a breakpoint that was made by bootstrap class, these manipulate the size of the columns, and it has 2 other breakpoint in css.

# Built-with:

It was built in my desktop editor, brackets.
